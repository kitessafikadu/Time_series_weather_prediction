# Time Series Weather Forecast

This project is a web application that forecasts weather conditions using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for time series predictions. 
The weather input comes from openweather.com based on latitude and longitude of a location.
The application is built with a FastAPI backend, a React frontend, and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- **Weather Data Forecasting**: Predict future weather conditions based on historical data.
- **Interactive Frontend**: User-friendly interface for inputting latitude and longitude as to be input to predictions.
- **RESTful API**: Backend built with FastAPI to handle data processing and model inference.
- **Real-Time Visualizations**: Dynamic pages for displaying forecasted weather trends.
- **Input Data from OpenWeather**: Fetches weather data based on latitude and longitude using the OpenWeather API.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **FastAPI**: For building RESTful API endpoints.
- **LSTM Model**: Implemented using TensorFlow/Keras for time series forecasting.
- **Python**: Main programming language for backend logic and machine learning.

### Frontend
- **React**: For building an interactive user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application.

### Other Tools
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data processing and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Plotly**: Data visualization.
